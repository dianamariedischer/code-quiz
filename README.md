## Usage

This quiz is meant for students who would like to sharpen their knowledge of javascript fundamentals, and compare their scores with others locally. 

When a user opens the page they are met with a start button as well as a link to view high scores. If they start the quiz a timer will count down from 75 while the user answers questions. If the user picks an incorrect answer, they lose 10 seconds. A comment appears after an answer has been clicked that indicates whether their answer was correct or incorrect.

Once they complete the quiz or run out of time they are presented with a score (their remaining time), and asked for their initals. Their initials and scores are then added to the high score list and they are shown the rest of the stored scores.

If they click to see the high score page at any point it will stop the timer. They can also clear the scores, which removes all of the stored scores.
